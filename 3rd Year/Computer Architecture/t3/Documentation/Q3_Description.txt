Q3 - I have used the time library in python. This library contains process_time()
which returns the float value of time in seconds. The time before and after executing
ackermann(3,6) is recorded and the difference is the total time it takes to calculate 
the function. The program was run 1000 times and the average time was calculated to 
provide a more accurate result.
